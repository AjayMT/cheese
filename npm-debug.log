30 silly publish   readme: '# Cheese\n\n[![](https://travis-ci.org/AjayMT/cheese.svg?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/AjayMT/cheese)\n\nCheese is a minimalistic and flexible javascript web framework that lets you build reactive apps with the libraries you want. This means you don\'t have to worry about client-server communication, you don\'t have to worry about updating the DOM, you don\'t have to worry about a database server, you get lots of flexibility and a high degree of customization, and your app is extremely portable because it runs wherever you have [node](http://nodejs.org). When you use Cheese, all you need to worry about is your app.\n\n**As of now, Cheese is pretty beta-ish, and is evolving quickly. It may not be completely stable yet, so use it at your own risk.**\n\n## Installation\n\nGet [node](http://nodejs.org) if you don\'t have it. Then do the following:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g cheese\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\nClone the repository, `cd` into it and do the following:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install # to install devDependencies\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [wiki](https://github.com/AjayMT/cheese/wiki).\n\n## Changes in Cheese 0.6.0\n\nNew features -\n\n- Pattern matching in routes\n- Perform HTTP requests in the client asynchronously\n- Send & receive custom server-client messages\n\nFixes/Improvements -\n\n- Better latency compensation (i.e the client loads the DOM without waiting for the server to send data)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License. See `./LICENSE` for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheese is open-source and contributions are welcome. Just make sure that you fork and send a pull request to the **develop** branch, since this is where all development happens (the master branch is the latest stable version).\n',
